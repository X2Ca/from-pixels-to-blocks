# From Pixels to Blocks
### A Color-Based 3D Transformation System

Created by: Cocoboyy

## Overview
This project explores the transformation of 2D image data into volumetric 3D block-based models.

Using color as the primary guiding parameter—combined with structural and spatial analysis—the system reconstructs images into layered modular 3D forms.

The result is a stylized yet data-driven volumetric interpretation that bridges digital imagery and three-dimensional abstraction.

## Features
- 2D image parsing
- Color-driven spatial analysis
- Grid-based square generation
- Volumetric cube transformation
- Modular 3D structure reconstruction

## Technologies Used
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLSL
- GLFW / GLAD 

## Roadmap
- [ ] Generate full 2D grid
- [ ] Convert squares into cubes
- [ ] Add lighting & shading
- [ ] Export 3D model
- [ ] Optimize performance
